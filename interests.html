      <p>For now, this is just going to be really ugly because I don't know exactly what I want it to look like yet. I know that I need to add some pictures of me and maybe some other stuff as well, but ya know. It's basically just going to suck for now.</p>

      <h2>Professional Stuff</h2>
      <p>I am entering my senior year in the electrical and computer engineering program at the University of Colorado, Boulder and will be focusing on dynamics and controls along with embedded systems. I figure that people will pretty much always need robots and stuff to control robots, so controls mixed with embedded systems is probably a pretty safe career choice. Of course, that wouldn't really mean anything if I didn't enjoy the material.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing this (mid August, 2017) I have yet to take any controls classes, but am signed up for two in the coming school year. I am actually really excited for these because I think it's going to give me a chance to actually incorporate a lot of the things I have learned during my time at CU. It should also let me continue to dive deeper into the embedded systems world, which will be great. </p>
      <p> I took my first embedded systems course as my sophomore elective, and it was amazing. I have always been interested in how smaller, specialized devices work, and now I actually have some experience with making those devices. That class really helped me to better understand programming and direct memory manipulation, but also helped to spark an interest in system control in me. After taking that class, I started working at the Colorado Space Grant Consortium at CU, working on the RocketSat-X 11 team from CU. I worked on the avionics team where we designed and created a deployment system for a composite slit tube boom. </p>
      <p> I worked at Halleck Willard Inc. over the summer of 2017 as an embedded systems intern. While there I worked primarily on porting code and designing hardware to mimic the Eggbot Pro with a Renesas S1 microcontroller. This was a great experience for me; not only did I gain some experience with a new microcontroller, but I also learned how to more efficiently read and understand code written by another developer that wasn't necesarily intended to be understood easily. Working with the Renesas S1 chip and the Synergy Software Package also allowed me to learn some of the basics of working with an RTOS. </p>
      <h2> THAT BIT ABOUT THE RTOS NEEDS MORE EXPLANATION, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO ADD. MAYBE EMBED A VIDEO OF THE THING WORKING IN HERE. </h2>

      <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
      <p>I split my freetime between a couple interests. Lately I've been reading a lot of Brandon Sanderson, because his Cosmere works have really engrossed me. I really enjoy the Mistborn books, but have been slowly getting into the Stormlight Archive as well. I think I like the books so much because the magic systems in them are so fleshed out. There are rules to the systems, which feels more real to me I guess. Also the characters are well written and feel like people. I'd say that's pretty important. </p>
      <p>I really enjoy cooking as well. I say cooking, but if I am being honest with myself, it's the baking I like more. My mom makes this really good Texas sheet cake (if you are not familiar with Texas sheet cake, I feel very sorry for you) that she gave the recipe for. I make it from time to time for my friends, and I've occasionally made it for my co-workers. It never lasts more than 3 days, which is amazing, seeing as its about 4 pounds of cake. It's just that good. Other than baked goods, I really enjoy experimenting with new recipes. For example, I found this recipe for vegetarian black bean enchiladas the other day, and they have changed me. They are so good. In fact, I think I am going to make them again tonight. </p>
      <p>I'd have to say my other great interest is playing games with my friends. We play a lot of Overwatch, (I mainly play a healer) but of late, we have been looking forward to Destiny 2. Only one of my friends played the original Destiny, but she can be very persuasive. We have also recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons, and it's been a good time. In DnD my current character is a tiefling sorceror who flatters every single person he talks to, and can only seem to hit trees with his spells. I went to freeze a goblin the last time we played, but I rolled so poorly that my character ended up hitting a tree behind the goblin, freezing it solid, and the tree was in just the right postition so that the sun shone through the frozen trunk, was refracted, and blinded everyone in a twenty foot radius around it. It was kind of hilarious.</p>
